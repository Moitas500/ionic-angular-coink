# Ionic angular coink

## Developer guide

### Run application

Requirements:

- NodeJS version 20 or latest.
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- Ionic CLI (`npm install -g @ionic/cli`)

Run Angular project:

```bash
# Just install dependencies:
npm ci
# Or install and update dependencies:
npm install
# Run Ionic server in local machine:
ionic serve
# Build app

```
The project has an error with some styles, but due to time issues I cannot solve it. Just in case, 
Reload to see all styles in the app.
